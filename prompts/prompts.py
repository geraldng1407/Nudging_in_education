Task: Chunk Text into Sections
You are provided with a piece of text. Your task is to chunk the text into sections based on the content.
At the start of each paragraph, there is a paragraph index. You will return the start and end index to group the paragraphs into sections.
If the paragraph is irrelevant, you should not include it in the output. A paragrpah is irrelevant if it does not add to the main content of the text.
A paragraph is considered irrelevant if it contains any of the following:
Irrelevant Text Examples:
- Table of contents
- References
- Acknowledgements
- Author information
- Header Information
- Preface information

Example:
Input:

So far, several attempts have been made to achieve a gradual transfer towards autonomy using other options than external regulation.
Workplace simulations were implemented, intended to improve autonomous learning behavior in an environment reflecting the future workspace.
It became clear, however, that simply giving autonomy in these workplace simulations was not enough to promote studentsâ€™ autonomous learning behavior.
Output: 'start': 1, 'end': 3, 'title': 'Attempts to Achieve Autonomy'
Try to ensure that each section should be at least 20 sentences long.

Input:
{document}: A piece of text that needs to be chunked into sections.
Output:

# You are an advanced programming assistant who specializes in creating visual representations of data using code in various charting languages, particularly focusing on Mermaid.js. 
# You have a knack for transforming complex data structures and ideas into easy-to-understand mind maps, leveraging your extensive experience in coding and visualization.

# Your task is to generate Mermaid chart code that accurately visualizes the provided text as a mind map. Follow these steps:

# 1. Identify the **Main Topic** from the text.
# 2. Extract **Subtopics** relevant to the Main Topic.
# 3. Determine **Relationships** (e.g., connections between subtopics).
# 4. Note any **Additional Annotations or notes** for specific nodes if necessary.
# 5. **Enhance only the leaf nodes** with descriptive sentences to provide more context and clarity in the visualization. Non-leaf nodes should reflect the theme of their branches without additional descriptions.

# Make sure that the final output is structured correctly for Mermaid.js, focusing on clarity and ease of understanding in the visualization.

# **Input:**
# {document}: A segment of text that needs to be visualized as a mind map using Mermaid.js.

Your task is to generate Mermaid chart code that accurately visualizes the provided text as a mind map. Follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Main Topic:**
   - Extract the primary subject or central theme from the input text.

2. **Extract Subtopics:**
   - Identify key subtopics that branch out from the Main Topic.
   - Ensure subtopics are distinct and cover all significant aspects of the Main Topic.

3. **Determine Relationships:**
   - Define how subtopics interconnect or relate to each other and to the Main Topic.
   - Establish hierarchical or associative links as appropriate.

4. **Add Additional Annotations or Notes:**
   - Include relevant notes for specific nodes to provide extra context where necessary.
   - Use annotations to clarify complex relationships or concepts.

5. **Enhance Leaf Nodes:**
   - For all leaf nodes (nodes without further sub-branches), add descriptive sentences that offer more context and clarity.
   - Ensure non-leaf nodes succinctly reflect the theme of their branches without additional descriptions.

6. **Analyze Feedback:**
   - **Review Feedback Entries:**
     - Examine each feedback object, focusing on both the 'rating' and 'comments' fields.
     - Note the numerical ratings to gauge overall satisfaction.
     - Carefully read comments to understand specific praises, concerns, or suggestions.
   - **Identify Common Themes:**
     - Look for recurring issues or frequently mentioned points in the comments.
     - Categorize feedback into positive aspects to retain and areas needing improvement.
   - **Prioritize Feedback:**
     - Focus on feedback with lower ratings (e.g., below 4) as these indicate significant areas for enhancement.
     - Address the most common or impactful issues first to ensure the most critical problems are resolved.

7. **Incorporate Feedback:**
   - **Adjust Complexity:**
     - Simplify overly complex sections or add necessary details to under-explained areas based on feedback.
   - **Enhance Clarity:**
     - Rephrase or restructure parts of the mind map that were found confusing or unclear.
   - **Improve Structure:**
     - Reorganize the hierarchy or relationships between nodes to better reflect logical connections as suggested by feedback.
   - **Address Specific Issues:**
     - Tackle particular points raised in the comments, ensuring that previous shortcomings are effectively resolved.
   - **Validate Alignment with Expectations:**
     - Ensure that the final mind map closely aligns with user expectations and effectively addresses all highlighted areas from the feedback.
