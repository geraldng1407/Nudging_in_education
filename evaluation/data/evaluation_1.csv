"SUMMARY: On July 12, 1974, the National Research Act (Pub. L. 93-348) was signed into law, there-by creating the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. One of the charges to the Commission was to identify the basic ethical principles that should underlie the conduct of biomedical and behavioral research involving human subjects and to develop guidelines which should be followed to assure that such research is conducted in accordance with those principles. In carrying out the above, the Commission was directed to consider: (i) the boundaries between biomedical and behavioral research and the accepted and routine practice of medicine, (ii) the role of assessment of risk-benefit criteria in the determination of the appropriateness of research involving human subjects, (iii) appropriate guidelines for the selection of human subjects for participation in such research and (iv) the nature and definition of informed consent in various research settings.The Belmont Report attempts to summarize the basic ethical principles identified by the Commission in the course of its deliberations. It is the outgrowth of an intensive four-day period of discussions that were held in February 1976 at the Smithsonian Institution's Belmont Conference Center supplemented by the monthly deliberations of the Commission that were held over a period of nearly four years. It is a statement of basic ethical principles and guidelines that should assist in resolving the ethical problems that surround the conduct of research with human subjects. By publishing the Report in the Federal Register, and providing reprints upon request, the Secretary intends that it may be made readily available to scientists, members of Institutional Review Boards, and Federal employees. The two-volume Appendix, containing the lengthy reports of experts and specialists who assisted the Commission in fulfilling this part of its charge, is available as DHEW Publication No. (OS) 78-0013 and No. (OS) 78-0014, for sale by the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.Unlike most other reports of the Commission, the Belmont Report does not make specific recommendations for administrative action by the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. Rather, the Commission recommended that the Belmont Report be adopted in its entirety, as a statement of the Department's policy. The Department requests public comment on this recommendation.","National Research Act, National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research, ethical principles, biomedical and behavioral research, human subjects, guidelines, risk-benefit criteria, informed consent, Belmont Report, ethical problems, Institutional Review Boards, Federal Register, Department's policy, public comment","mindmap

"Part A: Boundaries Between Practice & ResearchA. Boundaries Between Practice and ResearchIt is important to distinguish between biomedical and behavioral research, on the one hand, and the practice of accepted therapy on the other, in order to know what activities ought to undergo review for the protection of human subjects of research. The distinction between research and practice is blurred partly because both often occur together (as in research designed to evaluate a therapy) and partly because notable departures from standard practice are often called ""experimental"" when the terms ""experimental"" and ""research"" are not carefully defined.For the most part, the term ""practice"" refers to interventions that are designed solely to enhance the well-being of an individual patient or client and that have a reasonable expectation of success. The purpose of medical or behavioral practice is to provide diagnosis, preventive treatment or therapy to particular individuals [2]. By contrast, the term ""research' designates an activity designed to test an hypothesis, permit conclusions to be drawn, and thereby to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge (expressed, for example, in theories, principles, and statements of relationships). Research is usually described in a formal protocol that sets forth an objective and a set of procedures designed to reach that objective.When a clinician departs in a significant way from standard or accepted practice, the innovation does not, in and of itself, constitute research. The fact that a procedure is ""experimental,"" in the sense of new, untested or different, does not automatically place it in the category of research. Radically new procedures of this description should, however, be made the object of formal research at an early stage in order to determine whether they are safe and effective. Thus, it is the responsibility of medical practice committees, for example, to insist that a major innovation be incorporated into a formal research project [3].Research and practice may be carried on together when research is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a therapy. This need not cause any confusion regarding whether or not the activity requires review; the general rule is that if there is any element of research in an activity, that activity should undergo review for the protection of human subjects.","Boundaries Between Practice & Research, biomedical research, behavioral research, practice of accepted therapy, protection of human subjects, research and practice distinction, experimental procedures, formal research, medical practice committees, safety and efficacy evaluation","mindmap

"Part B: Basic Ethical PrinciplesB. Basic Ethical PrinciplesThe expression ""basic ethical principles"" refers to those general judgments that serve as a basic justification for the many particular ethical prescriptions and evaluations of human actions. Three basic principles, among those generally accepted in our cultural tradition, are particularly relevant to the ethics of research involving human subjects: the principles of respect of persons, beneficence and justice.1. Respect for Persons. -- Respect for persons incorporates at least two ethical convictions: first, that individuals should be treated as autonomous agents, and second, that persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to protection. The principle of respect for persons thus divides into two separate moral requirements: the requirement to acknowledge autonomy and the requirement to protect those with diminished autonomy.An autonomous person is an individual capable of deliberation about personal goals and of acting under the direction of such deliberation. To respect autonomy is to give weight to autonomous persons' considered opinions and choices while refraining from obstructing their actions unless they are clearly detrimental to others. To show lack of respect for an autonomous agent is to repudiate that person's considered judgments, to deny an individual the freedom to act on those considered judgments, or to withhold information necessary to make a considered judgment, when there are no compelling reasons to do so.However, not every human being is capable of self-determination. The capacity for self-determination matures during an individual's life, and some individuals lose this capacity wholly or in part because of illness, mental disability, or circumstances that severely restrict liberty. Respect for the immature and the incapacitated may require protecting them as they mature or while they are incapacitated.Some persons are in need of extensive protection, even to the point of excluding them from activities which may harm them; other persons require little protection beyond making sure they undertake activities freely and with awareness of possible adverse consequence. The extent of protection afforded should depend upon the risk of harm and the likelihood of benefit. The judgment that any individual lacks autonomy should be periodically reevaluated and will vary in different situations.In most cases of research involving human subjects, respect for persons demands that subjects enter into the research voluntarily and with adequate information. In some situations, however, application of the principle is not obvious. The involvement of prisoners as subjects of research provides an instructive example. On the one hand, it would seem that the principle of respect for persons requires that prisoners not be deprived of the opportunity to volunteer for research. On the other hand, under prison conditions they may be subtly coerced or unduly influenced to engage in research activities for which they would not otherwise volunteer. Respect for persons would then dictate that prisoners be protected. Whether to allow prisoners to ""volunteer"" or to ""protect"" them presents a dilemma. Respecting persons, in most hard cases, is often a matter of balancing competing claims urged by the principle of respect itself.2. Beneficence. -- Persons are treated in an ethical manner not only by respecting their decisions and protecting them from harm, but also by making efforts to secure their well-being. Such treatment falls under the principle of beneficence. The term ""beneficence"" is often understood to cover acts of kindness or charity that go beyond strict obligation. In this document, beneficence is understood in a stronger sense, as an obligation. Two general rules have been formulated as complementary expressions of beneficent actions in this sense: (1) do not harm and (2) maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms.The Hippocratic maxim ""do no harm"" has long been a fundamental principle of medical ethics. Claude Bernard extended it to the realm of research, saying that one should not injure one person regardless of the benefits that might come to others. However, even avoiding harm requires learning what is harmful; and, in the process of obtaining this information, persons may be exposed to risk of harm. Further, the Hippocratic Oath requires physicians to benefit their patients ""according to their best judgment."" Learning what will in fact benefit may require exposing persons to risk. The problem posed by these imperatives is to decide when it is justifiable to seek certain benefits despite the risks involved, and when the benefits should be foregone because of the risks.The obligations of beneficence affect both individual investigators and society at large, because they extend both to particular research projects and to the entire enterprise of research. In the case of particular projects, investigators and members of their institutions are obliged to give forethought to the maximization of benefits and the reduction of risk that might occur from the research investigation. In the case of scientific research in general, members of the larger society are obliged to recognize the longer term benefits and risks that may result from the improvement of knowledge and from the development of novel medical, psychotherapeutic, and social procedures.The principle of beneficence often occupies a well-defined justifying role in many areas of research involving human subjects. An example is found in research involving children. Effective ways of treating childhood diseases and fostering healthy development are benefits that serve to justify research involving children -- even when individual research subjects are not direct beneficiaries. Research also makes it possible to avoid the harm that may result from the application of previously accepted routine practices that on closer investigation turn out to be dangerous. But the role of the principle of beneficence is not always so unambiguous. A difficult ethical problem remains, for example, about research that presents more than minimal risk without immediate prospect of direct benefit to the children involved. Some have argued that such research is inadmissible, while others have pointed out that this limit would rule out much research promising great benefit to children in the future. Here again, as with all hard cases, the different claims covered by the principle of beneficence may come into conflict and force difficult choices.3. Justice. -- Who ought to receive the benefits of research and bear its burdens? This is a question of justice, in the sense of ""fairness in distribution"" or ""what is deserved."" An injustice occurs when some benefit to which a person is entitled is denied without good reason or when some burden is imposed unduly. Another way of conceiving the principle of justice is that equals ought to be treated equally. However, this statement requires explication. Who is equal and who is unequal? What considerations justify departure from equal distribution? Almost all commentators allow that distinctions based on experience, age, deprivation, competence, merit and position do sometimes constitute criteria justifying differential treatment for certain purposes. It is necessary, then, to explain in what respects people should be treated equally. There are several widely accepted formulations of just ways to distribute burdens and benefits. Each formulation mentions some relevant property on the basis of which burdens and benefits should be distributed. These formulations are (1) to each person an equal share, (2) to each person according to individual need, (3) to each person according to individual effort, (4) to each person according to societal contribution, and (5) to each person according to merit.Questions of justice have long been associated with social practices such as punishment, taxation and political representation. Until recently these questions have not generally been associated with scientific research. However, they are foreshadowed even in the earliest reflections on the ethics of research involving human subjects. For example, during the 19th and early 20th centuries the burdens of serving as research subjects fell largely upon poor ward patients, while the benefits of improved medical care flowed primarily to private patients. Subsequently, the exploitation of unwilling prisoners as research subjects in Nazi concentration camps was condemned as a particularly flagrant injustice. In this country, in the 1940's, the Tuskegee syphilis study used disadvantaged, rural black men to study the untreated course of a disease that is by no means confined to that population. These subjects were deprived of demonstrably effective treatment in order not to interrupt the project, long after such treatment became generally available.Against this historical background, it can be seen how conceptions of justice are relevant to research involving human subjects. For example, the selection of research subjects needs to be scrutinized in order to determine whether some classes (e.g., welfare patients, particular racial and ethnic minorities, or persons confined to institutions) are being systematically selected simply because of their easy availability, their compromised position, or their manipulability, rather than for reasons directly related to the problem being studied. Finally, whenever research supported by public funds leads to the development of therapeutic devices and procedures, justice demands both that these not provide advantages only to those who can afford them and that such research should not unduly involve persons from groups unlikely to be among the beneficiaries of subsequent applications of the research.","basic ethical principles, respect for persons, beneficence, justice, autonomy, human research, protection, beneficence obligation, avoid harm, maximize benefits, justice in research, distribution fairness, research burdens, ethical research, informed consent, prisoner research, research involving children, risk and benefit balance, exploitation in research, Tuskegee syphilis study, therapeutic development, public fund research","mindmap

","The context outlines three fundamental ethical principles crucial to research involving human subjects: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Respect for persons involves treating individuals as autonomous agents and protecting those with diminished autonomy. The principle of beneficence emphasizes doing no harm and maximizing benefits, requiring researchers to consider the well-being of participants. Justice concerns the fair distribution of research benefits and burdens, ensuring no group is unfairly burdened or denied benefits.

"Part C: ApplicationsC. ApplicationsApplications of the general principles to the conduct of research leads to consideration of the following requirements: informed consent, risk/benefit assessment, and the selection of subjects of research.1. Informed Consent. -- Respect for persons requires that subjects, to the degree that they are capable, be given the opportunity to choose what shall or shall not happen to them. This opportunity is provided when adequate standards for informed consent are satisfied.While the importance of informed consent is unquestioned, controversy prevails over the nature and possibility of an informed consent. Nonetheless, there is widespread agreement that the consent process can be analyzed as containing three elements: information, comprehension and voluntariness.Information. Most codes of research establish specific items for disclosure intended to assure that subjects are given sufficient information. These items generally include: the research procedure, their purposes, risks and anticipated benefits, alternative procedures (where therapy is involved), and a statement offering the subject the opportunity to ask questions and to withdraw at any time from the research. Additional items have been proposed, including how subjects are selected, the person responsible for the research, etc.However, a simple listing of items does not answer the question of what the standard should be for judging how much and what sort of information should be provided. One standard frequently invoked in medical practice, namely the information commonly provided by practitioners in the field or in the locale, is inadequate since research takes place precisely when a common understanding does not exist. Another standard, currently popular in malpractice law, requires the practitioner to reveal the information that reasonable persons would wish to know in order to make a decision regarding their care. This, too, seems insufficient since the research subject, being in essence a volunteer, may wish to know considerably more about risks gratuitously undertaken than do patients who deliver themselves into the hand of a clinician for needed care. It may be that a standard of ""the reasonable volunteer"" should be proposed: the extent and nature of information should be such that persons, knowing that the procedure is neither necessary for their care nor perhaps fully understood, can decide whether they wish to participate in the furthering of knowledge. Even when some direct benefit to them is anticipated, the subjects should understand clearly the range of risk and the voluntary nature of participation.A special problem of consent arises where informing subjects of some pertinent aspect of the research is likely to impair the validity of the research. In many cases, it is sufficient to indicate to subjects that they are being invited to participate in research of which some features will not be revealed until the research is concluded. In all cases of research involving incomplete disclosure, such research is justified only if it is clear that (1) incomplete disclosure is truly necessary to accomplish the goals of the research, (2) there are no undisclosed risks to subjects that are more than minimal, and (3) there is an adequate plan for debriefing subjects, when appropriate, and for dissemination of research results to them. Information about risks should never be withheld for the purpose of eliciting the cooperation of subjects, and truthful answers should always be given to direct questions about the research. Care should be taken to distinguish cases in which disclosure would destroy or invalidate the research from cases in which disclosure would simply inconvenience the investigator.Comprehension. The manner and context in which information is conveyed is as important as the information itself. For example, presenting information in a disorganized and rapid fashion, allowing too little time for consideration or curtailing opportunities for questioning, all may adversely affect a subject's ability to make an informed choice.Because the subject's ability to understand is a function of intelligence, rationality, maturity and language, it is necessary to adapt the presentation of the information to the subject's capacities. Investigators are responsible for ascertaining that the subject has comprehended the information. While there is always an obligation to ascertain that the information about risk to subjects is complete and adequately comprehended, when the risks are more serious, that obligation increases. On occasion, it may be suitable to give some oral or written tests of comprehension.Special provision may need to be made when comprehension is severely limited -- for example, by conditions of immaturity or mental disability. Each class of subjects that one might consider as incompetent (e.g., infants and young children, mentally disable patients, the terminally ill and the comatose) should be considered on its own terms. Even for these persons, however, respect requires giving them the opportunity to choose to the extent they are able, whether or not to participate in research. The objections of these subjects to involvement should be honored, unless the research entails providing them a therapy unavailable elsewhere. Respect for persons also requires seeking the permission of other parties in order to protect the subjects from harm. Such persons are thus respected both by acknowledging their own wishes and by the use of third parties to protect them from harm.The third parties chosen should be those who are most likely to understand the incompetent subject's situation and to act in that person's best interest. The person authorized to act on behalf of the subject should be given an opportunity to observe the research as it proceeds in order to be able to withdraw the subject from the research, if such action appears in the subject's best interest.Voluntariness. An agreement to participate in research constitutes a valid consent only if voluntarily given. This element of informed consent requires conditions free of coercion and undue influence. Coercion occurs when an overt threat of harm is intentionally presented by one person to another in order to obtain compliance. Undue influence, by contrast, occurs through an offer of an excessive, unwarranted, inappropriate or improper reward or other overture in order to obtain compliance. Also, inducements that would ordinarily be acceptable may become undue influences if the subject is especially vulnerable.Unjustifiable pressures usually occur when persons in positions of authority or commanding influence -- especially where possible sanctions are involved -- urge a course of action for a subject. A continuum of such influencing factors exists, however, and it is impossible to state precisely where justifiable persuasion ends and undue influence begins. But undue influence would include actions such as manipulating a person's choice through the controlling influence of a close relative and threatening to withdraw health services to which an individual would otherwise be entitled.2. Assessment of Risks and Benefits. -- The assessment of risks and benefits requires a careful arrayal of relevant data, including, in some cases, alternative ways of obtaining the benefits sought in the research. Thus, the assessment presents both an opportunity and a responsibility to gather systematic and comprehensive information about proposed research. For the investigator, it is a means to examine whether the proposed research is properly designed. For a review committee, it is a method for determining whether the risks that will be presented to subjects are justified. For prospective subjects, the assessment will assist the determination whether or not to participate.The Nature and Scope of Risks and Benefits. The requirement that research be justified on the basis of a favorable risk/benefit assessment bears a close relation to the principle of beneficence, just as the moral requirement that informed consent be obtained is derived primarily from the principle of respect for persons. The term ""risk"" refers to a possibility that harm may occur. However, when expressions such as ""small risk"" or ""high risk"" are used, they usually refer (often ambiguously) both to the chance (probability) of experiencing a harm and the severity (magnitude) of the envisioned harm.The term ""benefit"" is used in the research context to refer to something of positive value related to health or welfare. Unlike, ""risk,"" ""benefit"" is not a term that expresses probabilities. Risk is properly contrasted to probability of benefits, and benefits are properly contrasted with harms rather than risks of harm. Accordingly, so-called risk/benefit assessments are concerned with the probabilities and magnitudes of possible harm and anticipated benefits. Many kinds of possible harms and benefits need to be taken into account. There are, for example, risks of psychological harm, physical harm, legal harm, social harm and economic harm and the corresponding benefits. While the most likely types of harms to research subjects are those of psychological or physical pain or injury, other possible kinds should not be overlooked.Risks and benefits of research may affect the individual subjects, the families of the individual subjects, and society at large (or special groups of subjects in society). Previous codes and Federal regulations have required that risks to subjects be outweighed by the sum of both the anticipated benefit to the subject, if any, and the anticipated benefit to society in the form of knowledge to be gained from the research. In balancing these different elements, the risks and benefits affecting the immediate research subject will normally carry special weight. On the other hand, interests other than those of the subject may on some occasions be sufficient by themselves to justify the risks involved in the research, so long as the subjects' rights have been protected. Beneficence thus requires that we protect against risk of harm to subjects and also that we be concerned about the loss of the substantial benefits that might be gained from research.The Systematic Assessment of Risks and Benefits. It is commonly said that benefits and risks must be ""balanced"" and shown to be ""in a favorable ratio."" The metaphorical character of these terms draws attention to the difficulty of making precise judgments. Only on rare occasions will quantitative techniques be available for the scrutiny of research protocols. However, the idea of systematic, nonarbitrary analysis of risks and benefits should be emulated insofar as possible. This ideal requires those making decisions about the justifiability of research to be thorough in the accumulation and assessment of information about all aspects of the research, and to consider alternatives systematically. This procedure renders the assessment of research more rigorous and precise, while making communication between review board members and investigators less subject to misinterpretation, misinformation and conflicting judgments. Thus, there should first be a determination of the validity of the presuppositions of the research; then the nature, probability and magnitude of risk should be distinguished with as much clarity as possible. The method of ascertaining risks should be explicit, especially where there is no alternative to the use of such vague categories as small or slight risk. It should also be determined whether an investigator's estimates of the probability of harm or benefits are reasonable, as judged by known facts or other available studies.Finally, assessment of the justifiability of research should reflect at least the following considerations: (i) Brutal or inhumane treatment of human subjects is never morally justified. (ii) Risks should be reduced to those necessary to achieve the research objective. It should be determined whether it is in fact necessary to use human subjects at all. Risk can perhaps never be entirely eliminated, but it can often be reduced by careful attention to alternative procedures. (iii) When research involves significant risk of serious impairment, review committees should be extraordinarily insistent on the justification of the risk (looking usually to the likelihood of benefit to the subject -- or, in some rare cases, to the manifest voluntariness of the participation). (iv) When vulnerable populations are involved in research, the appropriateness of involving them should itself be demonstrated. A number of variables go into such judgments, including the nature and degree of risk, the condition of the particular population involved, and the nature and level of the anticipated benefits. (v) Relevant risks and benefits must be thoroughly arrayed in documents and procedures used in the informed consent process.3. Selection of Subjects. -- Just as the principle of respect for persons finds expression in the requirements for consent, and the principle of beneficence in risk/benefit assessment, the principle of justice gives rise to moral requirements that there be fair procedures and outcomes in the selection of research subjects.Justice is relevant to the selection of subjects of research at two levels: the social and the individual. Individual justice in the selection of subjects would require that researchers exhibit fairness: thus, they should not offer potentially beneficial research only to some patients who are in their favor or select only ""undesirable"" persons for risky research. Social justice requires that distinction be drawn between classes of subjects that ought, and ought not, to participate in any particular kind of research, based on the ability of members of that class to bear burdens and on the appropriateness of placing further burdens on already burdened persons. Thus, it can be considered a matter of social justice that there is an order of preference in the selection of classes of subjects (e.g., adults before children) and that some classes of potential subjects (e.g., the institutionalized mentally infirm or prisoners) may be involved as research subjects, if at all, only on certain conditions.Injustice may appear in the selection of subjects, even if individual subjects are selected fairly by investigators and treated fairly in the course of research. Thus injustice arises from social, racial, sexual and cultural biases institutionalized in society. Thus, even if individual researchers are treating their research subjects fairly, and even if IRBs are taking care to assure that subjects are selected fairly within a particular institution, unjust social patterns may nevertheless appear in the overall distribution of the burdens and benefits of research. Although individual institutions or investigators may not be able to resolve a problem that is pervasive in their social setting, they can consider distributive justice in selecting research subjects.Some populations, especially institutionalized ones, are already burdened in many ways by their infirmities and environments. When research is proposed that involves risks and does not include a therapeutic component, other less burdened classes of persons should be called upon first to accept these risks of research, except where the research is directly related to the specific conditions of the class involved. Also, even though public funds for research may often flow in the same directions as public funds for health care, it seems unfair that populations dependent on public health care constitute a pool of preferred research subjects if more advantaged populations are likely to be the recipients of the benefits.One special instance of injustice results from the involvement of vulnerable subjects. Certain groups, such as racial minorities, the economically disadvantaged, the very sick, and the institutionalized may continually be sought as research subjects, owing to their ready availability in settings where research is conducted. Given their dependent status and their frequently compromised capacity for free consent, they should be protected against the danger of being involved in research solely for administrative convenience, or because they are easy to manipulate as a result of their illness or socioeconomic condition.","informed consent, risk/benefit assessment, selection of subjects, research ethics, respect for persons, voluntariness, comprehension, coercion, undue influence, beneficence, justice, social justice, individual justice, vulnerable populations, therapeutic component, distributive justice, research protocols, debriefing, comprehension tests, disclosure, research subjects, risks and benefits, moral requirements, research procedures, ethical considerations, informed choice, alternative procedures, research design, vulnerable subjects, systematic assessment, fair procedures, research selection, research validity, research outcomes, research participation, research obligations, research ethics principles, research assessment, research justification, research benefits, research risks, informed consent standards, research information, research comprehension, research voluntariness, research coercion, undue influence in research, research beneficence, research justice, research risk assessment, research benefit assessment, systematic research analysis, research subject protection, research subject selection, research fairness, research social justice, research individual justice, research vulnerable populations, research therapeutic component, research distributive justice, research protocol scrutiny, research debriefing, research comprehension tests, research disclosure, research subject risks, research moral requirements, research procedures ethics, research informed choice, research alternative procedures, research design ethics, research vulnerable subjects, research systematic assessment, research fair procedures, research selection ethics, research validity assessment, research outcomes ethics, research participation ethics, research obligations ethics, research ethics principles assessment, research assessment ethics, research justification ethics, research benefits ethics, research risks ethics, research informed consent ethics, research information ethics, research comprehension ethics, research voluntariness ethics, research coercion ethics, research undue influence ethics, research beneficence ethics, research justice ethics, research risk assessment ethics, research benefit assessment ethics, systematic research analysis ethics, research subject protection ethics, research subject selection ethics, research fairness ethics, research social justice ethics, research individual justice ethics, research vulnerable populations ethics, research therapeutic component ethics, research distributive justice ethics, research protocol scrutiny ethics, research debriefing ethics, research comprehension tests ethics, research disclosure ethics, research subject risks ethics, research moral requirements ethics, research procedures ethics, research informed choice ethics, research alternative procedures ethics, research design ethics, research vulnerable subjects ethics, research systematic assessment ethics, research fair procedures ethics, research selection ethics, research validity assessment ethics, research outcomes ethics, research participation ethics, research obligations ethics, research ethics principles assessment ethics","mindmap

Informed consent must include adequate information, comprehension, and voluntariness, allowing subjects to make informed choices. It emphasizes the importance of adapting information to subjects' understanding and ensuring voluntary participation free from coercion or undue influence.

The assessment of risks and benefits requires gathering comprehensive data to ensure that research risks are justified by benefits to subjects or society. Researchers must systematically analyze risks and benefits, considering alternative methods and ensuring that vulnerable populations are appropriately protected.

Subject selection should be fair, reflecting individual and social justice. Researchers must avoid biases and ensure that vulnerable populations are not disproportionately burdened by research participation.

"Systematic investigation A great deal of research in the social and behavioral sciences uses what is commonly thought of as the scientific method. However, the interpretation of the term ""systematic investigation"" depends largely upon discipline-specific methods. It is possible for research to be systematic without conforming in every respect to the elements of the conventional scientific method. For example, when ethnographers study communities, they may not have a priori hypotheses, but many aspects of their research may be systematic including the selection of subjects, decisions about what observations to record, and their interview process. ""Including research development, testing, and evaluation"" Pilot studies, feasibility studies, and other preliminary studies clearly fall under the definition of research. Both of the following preliminary components of a study constitute research with human subjects: A focus group of Latino immigrants to help researchers develop a questionnaire about how sexually transmitted diseases are transmitted across borders. Pilot testing of a questionnaire before the administration of the questionnaire and analysis of the results. ""Designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge"" To generalize is to derive general conclusions from particulars. Generalizable knowledge is a goal of most basic research. Even research about the most narrowly defined topic, such as an individual case study or the study of an isolated community, may be intended to contribute to a body of knowledge such as the function of culture, the expression of gender, or the political views of marginalized community members. Some researchers in the social and behavioral sciences and humanities contend that the regulations were designed to govern only biomedical research. They then, reasonably, assume that ""generalizable knowledge"" is only that which is hypothesis driven, quantitative, and replicable. While it is true that abuses in biomedical research drove the development of the current regulations, the regulations were designed to cover all research with human subjects. The regulations specifically refer to interviews, oral history, focus groups, and other qualitative methods. Therefore, the concept of ""generalizable knowledge"" has to be broadened. (The development of drugs, biologics, and medical devices is governed by a separate set of regulations developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.) An essential consideration is whether it was the intent of the researcher to contribute to generalizable knowledge. Some activities that involve interactions with humans and data gathering may not fit the definition of research with human subjects, because they are designed to accomplish something else, such as in-house quality improvement. For example, a survey of college students about university counseling services may be designed strictly to improve service delivery for students on that campus, and thus does not meet the definition of generalizability. Publication of results in a peer-reviewed journal is sometimes used as a measure of whether research is generalizable, but this is too narrow a measure for several reasons. First, not every study will produce results worthy of publication. Second, there are multiple ways in which results can be made available to others without being published in a peer-reviewed journal. Results may be presented at a conference or made the subject of a seminar. They may be shared with colleagues through the Internet or appear in a dissertation.","Systematic investigation, scientific method, discipline-specific methods, ethnographers, research development, testing, evaluation, pilot studies, feasibility studies, generalizable knowledge, basic research, qualitative methods, human subjects, regulations, biomedical research, generalizability, publication, peer-reviewed journal, conference, seminar, dissertation.","mindmap

The term ""generalizable knowledge"" refers to deriving broad conclusions from specific data, a key goal in basic research. However, some argue that regulations governing human research were designed primarily for biomedical studies, though they indeed cover a wider range of qualitative methods like interviews and focus groups.

"Defining ""Human Subject"" According to the regulations, a human subject is a ""living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research obtains: Data through intervention or interaction with the individual, or Identifiable private information."" The following four sections will consider key words and phrases in the definition. ""A living individual"" Research about people who are deceased, such as historical research, does not meet the definition of research with human subjects. ""About whom"" Most research in the social and behavioral sciences involves gathering information about individuals. However, some research that involves interactions with people does not meet the regulatory definition of research with human subjects because the focus of the investigation is not the opinions, characteristics, or behavior of the individual. In other words, the information being elicited is not about the individual (""whom""), but rather is about ""what"". For example, if a researcher calls the director of a shelter for battered women and asks her for the average length of stay of the women who use the shelter, that inquiry would not meet the definition of research with human subjects because the information requested is not ""about"" the director. If the researcher interviewed the director about her training, experience, and how she defines the problem of battering, then the inquiry becomes about her - and thus ""about whom."" ""Interactions"" Interactions include communication or interpersonal contact between the subject and the researcher. Communication does not have to be face to face, and may even exist entirely on paper or in electronic realms. Participant observation is a variant of interaction, often including both formal and informal interviews in addition to observation. ""Interventions"" Interventions include physical procedures through which data are gathered, such as measuring brain function to supplement paper and pencil inquiries into the development of language and behavioral interventions such as experimental education programs or unproven psycho-social therapies. They also include manipulation of the subject or the subject's environment performed for research purposes, for example, studies investigating the effect of music on memory. ""Identifiable private information"" Recruiting subjects, especially students, for a research study requires not only full disclosure but, also protections from coercion and loss of confidentiality. As defined in the regulations, private information includes: Information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place Information which has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and which the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (for example, a school record). The regulations further state that private information must be individually identifiable (that is, the identity of the subject is or may be readily ascertained by the researcher or associated with the information) in order for obtaining the information to constitute research with human subjects. The following two sections will expand on the definition of identifiable private information. Observing and Recording Private Behavior Subjects in observational research are also afforded protections from invasion of privacy. It is important to keep in mind that whether a setting is public is, by definition, determined in large part by the potential subjects' expectations of privacy, rather than any absolute distinctions between public and private spaces. For example, one might expect that certain behavior, even if conducted in public spaces, is in fact private, such as a conversation in a public park. It is reasonable to assume that one might expect not to be taped while dining with a date at a restaurant. Researchers who wish to obtain information in a context in which subjects would have a reasonable expectation of privacy may choose to use covert observation (concealed recording devices and videotaping or use of a one-way mirror) or assume a role in the setting or group being studied. Such studies raise significant concerns about violation of privacy and require additional protections and safeguards for subjects. Observational studies in quasi-public places, for example, hospital emergency rooms or state psychiatric hospital wards, may also raise such concerns. Private Information Provided by Individuals for Specific Purposes Individuals provide personal information with the expectation that it not be made public in a variety of settings, for example, at work, at school, when receiving health care, or as a member of an organization. Some of this information is protected by law. In Singapore, the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information is governed by Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) 2012. Please click on the links provided to understand more about the guidelines of PDPA 2012 (relevant sections include 'Analytics and Research', 'Anonymization' and 'Withdrawal of Consent'). Data files including identifiable private information are compiled and maintained by both public and private institutions. Owners of identifiable data impose restrictions on the use of the data. They may release de-identified data publicly, but only release identifiable data to investigators with IRB-approved data protection plans.","Human Subject, living individual, investigator, research, data, intervention, interaction, identifiable private information, deceased, social sciences, behavioral sciences, information, opinions, characteristics, behavior, interactions, communication, contact, participant observation, observation, interventions, procedures, brain function, language development, behavioral interventions, experimental education, psycho-social therapies, manipulation, environment, music, memory, recruiting, students, disclosure, coercion, confidentiality, regulations, behavior, context, observation, recording, school record, identity, private behavior, privacy, public spaces, covert observation, recording devices, videotaping, one-way mirror, quasi-public places, hospital, emergency room, psychiatric ward, personal information, Singapore, Personal Data Protection Act, PDPA 2012, Analytics and Research, Anonymization, Withdrawal of Consent, data files, institutions, IRB-approved data protection plans.","mindmap

"Respect for Persons Respect for persons incorporates at least two ethical convictions: first, that individuals should be treated as autonomous agents, and second, that persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to protection. The principle of respect for persons thus divides into two separate moral requirements: the requirement to acknowledge the autonomy and the requirement to protect those with diminished autonomy (The National Commission 1979). Autonomy Autonomy means that people must be empowered to make decisions concerning their own actions and well-being. According to the principle of respect for persons, researchers must acknowledge the ""considered opinions and choices"" of research subjects. In other words, individuals must be given the choice whether to participate in research, and they must be provided sufficient information and possess the mental competence to make that choice. Â Respect for Persons Â Subjects are fully informed about research Â Subjects choose to participate or not Respect for persons also recognizes that some individuals may not be capable of making decisions or choices that are in their best interest. Individuals with ""diminished decision-making capacity"" may lack the ability to comprehend study procedures or how participating in a study might adversely affect them. Special care should be taken to protect those with diminished capacity to the point of excluding individuals who are not able to give meaningful consent to participate in research. Children are a class of research subjects with limited autonomy. Typically, a parent or legal guardian must give permission for a child to participate in a study. Researchers also should ask child subjects for their assent by explaining the study in terms they can understand. Voluntariness Voluntariness is an essential component of respect for persons. Research subjects must be free to choose to participate in research. They also must be free to end their participation for any reason, without consequences. Voluntariness means more than offering people the choice to participate in or withdraw from research. Researchers should be aware of situations in which prospective subjects may feel pressured to participate in a study. In situations where a relationship between the researcher and subjects already exists, such as when a volunteer at a homeless shelter decides to conduct research with that population, the lines between voluntariness and undue influence may be blurred. People might be reluctant to decline participation if they have come to know the researcher in another role. Other examples of situations in which researchers may exert undue influence because they are in positions of authority include: Â Undue Influence Employers conducting research with their employees Professors conducting research with their students","Respect for Persons, autonomy, diminished autonomy, empowerment, decision-making, informed consent, voluntariness, diminished capacity, protection, ethical convictions, moral requirements, research subjects, meaningful consent, children, parental permission, legal guardian, assent, undue influence, authority, employers, professors, research participation","mindmap

Excellent summarization quality."
"Informed Consent A prospective research subject's autonomy is honored through the process of informed consent. The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP 2014) offers these guidelines: ÂThe informed consent process involves three key features: (1) disclosing to potential research subjects information needed to make an informed decision; (2) facilitating the understanding of what has been disclosed; and (3) promoting the voluntariness of the decision about whether or not to participate in the research.Â Researchers must provide certain essential points of information, such as: Â Purpose of the research Â Description of what the subject will be expected to do Â Any foreseeable risks of harm Â Participation is voluntary and subjects are free to withdraw at anytime The HHS regulations (Protection of Human Subjects 2018) require that the prospective subject be provided with information that a reasonable person would want in order to make an informed decision. Further, key information essential to decision-making should receive priority by appearing at the beginning of the consent document and being presented first in the consent discussion. Informed consent also must be comprehensible to prospective subjects. Comprehension is the ability to understand what one is being asked to do, as well as the implications of any risks of harm associated with participating in the research. Comprehension may depend on an individual's mental capacity, but it also relates to the comprehensibility of the informed consent document, or, in the case of oral consent, the script. Researchers should create consent processes that are at an appropriate language level for the subject population. Study information can be presented in a conversational style that is easily understood by a wide range of individuals. In general, an eighth-grade reading level or lower is advised. When conducting research in a language other than the researcher's native language, the researcher needs to ensure that translations are accurate and in the appropriate dialect and address idiomatic expressions that may not make sense in another language. The 2018 revisions to the Common Rule also noted that there may be subjects from a community or group where signing forms is not the norm. Researchers should consider requesting, from the reviewing IRB, approval of an appropriate alternative mechanism for documenting that informed consent was obtained (Protection of Human Subjects 2018). The Principles in Practice In Laud Humphreys' study, detailed in his book Tearoom Trade: Impersonal Sex in Public Places, the researcher observed men meeting other men for casual sexual encounters in public restrooms. Humphreys, then a sociology graduate student, gained the confidence of the men by pretending to be a participant and acting as a lookout. While Humphreys eventually revealed himself as a researcher to some of the men and was able to interview them openly, he withheld his identity from many others, recording the license plate numbers of a subset of 100 other tearoom regulars in order to contact them for interviews at a later date. A year after completing the observational part of the study, Humphreys followed up with these subjects, including them in a separate social health study that enabled him to conduct in-home surveys and gather data about their family relationships and religious background. In a 1970 article taken from his book, Humphreys maintained that the researcher's obligation to protect respondents from harm was a critical ethical assumption. To avoid being recognized by the interview subjects, Humphreys changed his appearance and the kind of car he drove. ÂI already knew that many of my respondents were married and that all were in a highly discreditable position and fearful of discovery. How could I approach these covert deviants for interviews? By passing as deviant, I had observed their sexual behavior without disturbing it. Now, I was faced with interviewing these men (often in the presence of their wives) without destroying themÂ (Humphreys 1970). Although the resulting book, based on Humphreys' dissertation, may have been beneficial in dispelling some stereotypes, the research violated the autonomy of the individuals who became part of Humphreys' study without their knowledge. HumphreyÂs Tearoom Trade Study Violated subjectsÂ autonomy Â subjects were not informed about the study, and did not choose whether to participate Humphreys' research occurred in a different regulatory environment, prior to the creation of the National Commission and the codification of federal regulations protecting human subjects. A more recent example of research that obtained personal information about individuals without their knowledge is the ""Tastes, Ties, and Time (T3)"" study (2006-2009). Sociologists gleaned voluminous and detailed personal information from the Facebook profiles of an entire class of undergraduates and followed those students over four years. The research team created an extensive data set that included studentsÂ gender, home state, major, political and group affiliations, friend networks, photographs, and tastes in music, books, and film. In 2008, the researchers made the data publicly available through the Dataverse Network Project. Although no students were identified by name, some data were specific enough to allow for re-identification of students by an outside researcher (Zimmer 2010; Parry 2011). Harvard University 'Tastes, Ties, and Time (T3)' Study Violated subjectsÂ autonomy and privacyÂ subjects did not agree to participate in the research, and subjects were able to be identified (failure of researchers to protect subjects from deductive disclosure) In both of these studies, the ethical concerns are invasion of privacy, lack of informed consent, and a failure to protect against deductive disclosure of identity. Beneficence Persons are treated in an ethical manner not only by respecting their decisions and protecting them from harm, but also by making efforts to secure their well-being. Such treatment falls under the principle of beneficence. The term 'beneficence' is often understood to cover acts of kindness or charity that go beyond strict obligation. In this document, beneficence is understood in a stronger sense, as an obligation. Two general rules have been formulated as complementary expression of beneficent actions in this sense: (1) do not harm and (2) maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms (The National Commission 1979). Minimizing Risks of Harm and Maximizing Possible Benefits Most research in the social and behavioral sciences, education, and humanities, does not provide direct benefit to subjects, and risks of harm tend to be minimal. Even so the goal for researchers is to conduct research where risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The most common risks of harm are psychological distress surrounding sensitive research and inadvertent disclosure of private identifiable information. Studies of sexuality, mental health, interpersonal violence, and illegal activities may create feelings of distress, as well as risk of embarrassment and reputational harm if private information that would not ordinarily be shared with a stranger or outsider, becomes public. Researchers may choose to use pseudonyms in an effort to protect the privacy of subjects, but other bits of information, taken alone or in combination, may be enough to allow for re-identification of subjects. A great deal of research in the social and behavioral sciences, however, involves minimal risk procedures, such as gathering and reporting on aggregate data using surveys and interviews. Some research involves deception, which is permissible, if researchers provide justification for the deception and prepare debriefing procedures for the subjects at the end of the study that describe the deception and explain the scientific rationale for its use (for exempt research under Category 3 using deception, the subject must authorize the deception prior to its use). Frequently, it is not the nature of the data collected but what the researcher does with the data that carries the most risk of harm for subjects. Data security and the very notion of privacy have changed dramatically with the explosion of social media, cloud storage, data mining of web-based information, and re-identification techniques. Refraining from collecting subject names is a simple way of reducing risk of harm due to inadvertent disclosure of private identifiable information. As we have seen from the T3 study, however, that is rarely sufficient as data re-identification has emerged as a growing computer science specialization. Latanya Sweeney (2000), director of the Data Privacy Lab at Harvard University, has demonstrated that 87 percent of Americans can be uniquely identified by only three bits of demographic information: five-digit zip code, gender, and date of birth.","informed consent, autonomy, research ethics, human subjects, OHRP guidelines, disclosure, comprehension, voluntariness, HHS regulations, comprehension, language level, translation, Common Rule, Laud Humphreys, Tearoom Trade, privacy, Tastes, Ties, and Time study, beneficence, minimize harm, maximize benefits, psychological distress, data security, re-identification, Latanya Sweeney","mindmap

      detailC(Data Security)","Informed consent is a fundamental ethical aspect of research, emphasizing the autonomy of subjects by ensuring they are fully informed about a study's purpose, procedures, risks, and their right to withdraw. It requires clear communication, often at an eighth-grade reading level, and adaptability for language and cultural differences. Noteworthy ethical breaches include Laud Humphreys' ""Tearoom Trade"" study and Harvard's ""Tastes, Ties, and Time (T3)"" study, both of which violated subjects' autonomy by gathering personal information without consent. Beneficence in research involves minimizing harm and maximizing benefits, with consideration for psychological risks and data privacy. Although social science research often involves minimal risk, the handling of data poses significant ethical challenges, particularly with the potential for re-identification using demographic information.",7,85,"The mindmap effectively covers several key aspects of informed consent, such as disclosure, comprehension, voluntariness, and ethical concerns related to privacy and informed consent.

"The Principles in Practice Social and behavioral sciences research has the potential to cause psychological and even physical distress. One example is, ""The Stanford Prison Experiment,"" Philip Zimbardo's 1971 landmark psychological study of the human response to captivity, specifically prison life. Zimbardo assigned roles to male student volunteers to create groups of ""prisoners"" and ""guards."" The simulation became so intense that physical and psychological abuse of ""prisoners"" by ""guards"" escalated and several of the subjects experienced distress less than 36 hours after the study began. Zimbardo's study, like Humphreys' study, occurred in a different regulatory environment, before the advent of the Belmont Report. Zimbardo did submit his research plan to an ethics board, but the consent process contained no provisions allowing subjects to withdraw at will, and no risks of harm beyond loss of privacy were addressed. According to Zimbardo (2012), the consent form signed by the subjects only allowed them ""to be released from participation for reasons of health deemed adequate by the medical advisers to the research project or for other reasons deemed appropriate by Dr. Philip Zimbardo."" Zimbardo did not stop the experiment until six days had passed. Â Stanford Prison Experiment Psychological Risks of Harm Physical Risks of Harm Other risks of harm may be social or reputational. With the publication of the 20th anniversary edition of her 1977 book, Saints, Scholars, and Schizophrenics: Mental Illness in Rural Ireland, ethnographer Nancy Scheper-Hughes reflected upon failing to protect the confidentiality and dignity of her subjects who felt that she had violated their trust and depicted the community in an unflattering light. Scheper-Hughes commented in her written account that, in retrospect, the use of pseudonyms and misleading indirect identifiers were inadequate as confidentiality measures because the subjects were easily able to identify themselves and their neighbors. I would be inclined to avoid the ""cute"" and ""conventional"" use of pseudonyms. Nor would I attempt to scramble certain identifying features of the individuals portrayed on the naÃ¯ve assumption that these masks and disguises could not be rather easily de-coded by the villagers themselves. I have come to see that the time-honored practice of bestowing anonymity on ""our"" communities and informants fools few and protects no one-save, perhaps, the anthropologist's own skin (Scheper-Hughes 2000). Â Nancy Scheper-Hughes' book Saints, Scholars, and Schizophrenics: Mental Illness in Rural Ireland Social Risks of Harm Reputational Risks of Harm Studies focusing on political violence or other illicit activities may expose subjects to legal harms. The legal issues surrounding the ""Boston College Oral History Archive of the Troubles in Northern Ireland"" demonstrate the difficulty of promising confidentiality to subjects. Former members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) agreed to be interviewed only if their accounts would remain sealed until their deaths. Subsequently, in response to a subpoena from the British government, the institution was ordered to turn over 85 interviews of former IRA members for use in Britain's investigation of unsolved murders (Dwyer 2011).

Zimbardo's study lacked proper consent protocols, allowing withdrawal only under specific conditions, and was conducted before stringent ethical guidelines like the Belmont Report existed. Similarly, Nancy Scheper-Hughes faced ethical dilemmas in her ethnographic work in Ireland, where inadequate confidentiality measures led to reputational harm for participants.

"Justice Who ought to receive the benefits of research and bear its burdens? This is a question of justice, in the sense of ""fairness in distribution"" or ""what is deserved."" An injustice occurs when some benefit to which a person is entitled is denied without good reason or when some burden is imposed unduly (The National Commission 1979). Distributing Benefits and Burdens of Research Justice requires that the benefits and burdens of research are equitably distributed -- that is, no individual or population is exposed to risks of harm while other individuals or populations receive the benefits. One example is cited in the Belmont Report (The National Commission 1979): ""During the 19th and early 20th centuries the burdens of serving as research subjects fell largely upon poor ward patients, while the benefits of improved medical care flowed primarily to private patients."" The Tuskegee Study and the Nazi experiments on concentration camp prisoners are well-documented examples of research injustices. Â Justice Â Benefits and burdens of research are equitably distributed Â Subject populations are not chosen because of convenience Similarly, researchers are discouraged from using prisoners, literally a captive population, as research subjects merely because they are a convenient study population. Other examples of populations chosen for convenience would be professors conducting research on their own students, or a researcher including subjects only on a particular social media platform because it is the most convenient (not because it is an adequate sample population for the research). In the context of examples such as the Tuskegee Study and the Nazi experiments, injustice is obvious. In non-medical research, however, the issue of justice presents in more nuanced ways. Lawrence O. Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, speaks to an ethical duty to research subjects that goes beyond non-harming. In thinking about justice toward subjects, researchers need to consider equitable selection so that individuals are chosen on the basis of factors clearly relevant to the problems being studied. Researchers also need to consider equitable distribution of advantages to research subjects and others who could benefit from the knowledge gained by the research (Gostin 1991, 191-201). Psychologist Joan E. Sieber maintains that the research question itself, as well as the interpretation of the data, may contain an inherent bias that singles out a particular group of subjects and leads to, or reinforces, unjust treatment of that group: ""One historically sensitive area of the application of research findings is examining racial differences. Another example relates to the use of psychological test results in order to promote a policy of sterilization for the mentally retarded population"" (Sieber and Stanley 1988). On the issue of justice, Sieber summarizes: Justice and equitable treatment refer to issues of procedural and distributive justice that may arise at any stage of the research process. An idea that creates prejudices against some sector of society is unfair. An experimental treatment is also unfair if resources known to be vital to subjects' well-being are withheld from subjects in one group and given to those in another.","Justice, benefits of research, burdens of research, fairness in distribution, research subjects, equitable distribution, Tuskegee Study, Nazi experiments, Lawrence O.

Gostin emphasize ethical duties beyond non-harming, advocating for relevant subject selection and fair distribution of research advantages. Joan E.

"The Principles in Practice In educational research testing (such as a new curriculum or teaching method), subjects in the treatment group may derive benefits from the intervention while subjects in the control group do not have access to that intervention. If the program being tested is specific to that age group, the control group participants would not have the opportunity to benefit from that intervention in the future. To fulfill the Belmont principle of justice, the control group must receive standard instruction. Balancing the Three Principles It was the National Commission's intention that each of the three principles should have equal moral force. This means that in some situations, the three principles might be in conflict with one another. For example, we might derive from the principle of respect for persons that we should limit the involvement of children in research because children are unable to choose for themselves. However, we might derive from the principle of justice that we must involve children in studies so that children will have the opportunity to benefit from the research. The Belmont Report states that one principle does not always outweigh another. Rather, we are required to consider each case separately and on its own merits while seeking to uphold all three principles. Â Use of Deception in Research Violates principle of respect for persons Adheres to principle of beneficence The issue of deception in research illustrates this tension between principles. When an Institutional Review Board (IRB) feels the use of deception is justified because the research question could not be answered if subjects were fully informed but there are potential benefits, the principle of beneficence holds greater weight than that of respect for persons. For example, deceptive experimental manipulations may be used to make subjects feel rejected in order to study the effects of social rejection.","The Principles in Practice, educational research, testing, new curriculum, teaching method, treatment group, control group, intervention, Belmont principle of justice, standard instruction, National Commission, moral force, respect for persons, involvement of children, principle of justice, Belmont Report, deception in research, principle of beneficence, Institutional Review Board (IRB), deceptive experimental manipulations, social rejection","mindmap

"The Belmont Report and the Common Rule The Common Rule (Protection of Human Subjects 2018) lists criteria for IRB approval of a research plan that are directly related to the three Belmont principles. Respect for Persons Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with, and to the extent required by 46.116. Informed consent will be appropriately documented, in accordance with, and to the extent required by 46.117. When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these subjects. Beneficence Risks to subjects are minimized: (i) By using procedures which are consistent with sound research design and which do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risk, and (ii) whenever appropriate, by using procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or treatment purposes. Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (for example, the possible effects of the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall within the purview of its responsibility. When appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects. When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data. Justice Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the setting in which the research will be conducted and should be particularly cognizant of the special problems of research involving vulnerable populations, such as children, prisoners, individuals with impaired decision-making capacity, or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons. Case StudyHistory and Ethical Principles Dr. Maccarone is a psychologist who is interested in conducting a study on factors that contribute to flare-ups of symptoms associated with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). He recruits adult subjects who have been diagnosed with GAD in the past year, and tells them during the consent process that the purpose of the study is to try to understand what causes GAD. If subjects agree to participate, they are told that they will only have to fill out the same survey twice (to account for ""lab coat anxiety""), separated by 10 minutes while having their blood pressure and EKG monitored. Once consented, the subjects complete their first survey that asks questions on the characteristics of their GAD and assessment of possible etiology. Unbeknownst to the subjects, they have been randomized to either complete the surveys in silence, or have background news playing through speakers. For those in the latter group, the broadcast is fictional and concentrates on reporting acts of terrorism, local shootings, airplane crashes, and other anxiety-inducing stories. Once the second survey is completed, the subject is thanked and leaves the laboratory.","The Belmont Report, Common Rule, IRB approval, Respect for Persons, informed consent, privacy, confidentiality, vulnerable subjects, Beneficence, risks and benefits, research design, monitoring data, Justice, equitable selection, vulnerable populations, Dr. Maccarone, generalized anxiety disorder, GAD, study, consent process, survey, anxiety-inducing stories","mindmap

"Introduction The public relies on the validity of research conducted at universities, academic medical centers, and other institutions. Public funds support much of the research done at these institutions, with the expectation that the work will adhere to the highest ethical standards and yield results that may benefit society. In response to congressional and public concerns regarding the objectivity of research due to the financial interests of investigators, U.S. institutions must take on increasing responsibilities regarding financial conflicts of interest (FCOIs). This module explains the rationale for institutions to address investigators' FCOIs, defines the principles used to assess the possible impact of financial interests on research, and provides strategies that can help eliminate or minimize bias in research. Learning Objectives By the end of this module, you should be able to: Recognize that institutions receiving funding from the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) agencies must require their investigators to disclose certain types of financial information. Describe how institutions collaborating on research projects identify, review, and manage conflicts of interest (COIs). Comprehend the expectations that institutions have as they review and evaluate their investigatorsÂ financial interest reports. Explain the circumstances under which an investigator's significant financial interest (SFI) or institutional financial interest could affect the objectivity of research. Recognize why institutions must develop management strategies to address FCOIs. Recognize that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires the sponsor of research to collect and report investigatorsÂ financial interests. Describe the public accessibility requirement in the PHS regulations. Describe the circumstances under which an institution must develop and implement a mitigation report. Overview of Institutional Obligations in Addressing Conflicts of Interest in Research Investigators seek to gain new knowledge and improve the health and welfare of the public. Society expects that relevant advances will be put to practical use. In the course of bringing an idea to fruition, investigators may receive compensation for the following: Â Their advice and consultation Â The rights to their inventions Â Speaking in educational forums","Introduction, public relies, validity of research, universities, academic medical centers, institutions, public funds, ethical standards, benefit society, congressional concerns, objectivity of research, financial interests, U.S. institutions, financial conflicts of interest (FCOIs), rationale, principles, strategies, bias, Learning Objectives, funding, U.S. Public Health Service (PHS), investigators, financial information, conflicts of interest (COIs), significant financial interest (SFI), management strategies, U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), sponsor, public accessibility, PHS regulations, mitigation report, Institutional Obligations, knowledge, health and welfare, advances, compensation, advice and consultation, inventions, educational forums.","mindmap

"Conflict Management When an institution identifies an FCOI related to PHS-funded research, it must develop and implement a management plan. Management may simply consist of a disclosure in presentations and manuscripts. It may also include measures such as removing the conflicted individual from primary oversight of the research or reducing or eliminating the financial interest. When reporting FCOIs to the PHS-awarding component, institutions must affirm the investigator's agreement to comply with a management plan. Reporting to PHS Awarding Components The regulations impose expanded reporting obligations on institutions for FCOIs in PHS-funded projects. Institutions must submit reports prior to the expenditure of funds and when competitive and non-competitive renewals are granted for ongoing projects. They must report newly disclosed FCOIs for PHS-funded research within 60 days of becoming aware of the new interest. They must also report annual updates at the times of submission of the annual progress reports. Institutions must report the following information to the PHS awarding component: The grant/contract number The name of the project director, principal investigator, or contact person (when there are multiple project directors or principal investigators) The name of the investigator with the FCOI The name of the entity with which the investigator has the FCOI The nature of the FCOI (such as equity, consulting fees, travel reimbursement, or honoraria) The value of the financial interest in specified ranges: $0-4,999, $5,000-9,999, $10,000-19,999, amounts between $20,000 and $100,000 by increments of $20,000, and amounts above $100,000 by increments of $50,000, or a statement that the interest is one whose value cannot be readily determined through reference to public prices or other reasonable measures of fair market value A description of how the SFI relates to the PHS-funded research and the basis for the institution's determination that the SFI conflicts with the research","Conflict Management, FCOI, PHS-funded research, management plan, disclosure, financial interest, reporting obligations, PHS awarding component, annual progress reports, grant/contract number, project director, principal investigator, consulting fees, travel reimbursement, honoraria, financial interest value, significant financial interest (SFI), fair market value","mindmap

"Elements of a Management Plan The institution must update the funding agency on the status of the FCOI and any changes to the management plan annually. In accordance with the regulations, an institution's management plan must describe the (Promoting Objectivity in Research 2011): A. Role and principal duties of the conflicted Investigator in the research project; B. Conditions of the management plan; C. How the management plan is designed to safeguard objectivity in the research project; D. Confirmation of the Investigator's agreement to the management plan; E. How the management plan will be monitored to ensure Investigator compliance; and F. Other information as needed. FDA Reporting Requirements for Investigational New Drug/Investigational Device Exemption (IND/IDE) Holders In accordance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations (21 CFR 54 [Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators 1998]), financial disclosures must be submitted to and retained by the sponsor of the research. The sponsor is the individual or entity that holds the IND or IDE for FDA-regulated research. If researchers hold the IND or IDE, the sponsor-investigator is responsible for collecting and maintaining financial disclosures and related management plans. The FDA (2013) provides guidance on how clinical investigators should handle financial disclosures. Public Disclosure Standards and Requirements The revised PHS regulations require institutions to make certain information about the FCOIs of senior/key personnel publicly available, which they can do in one of two ways: on a public website or in response to a written request within five business days. The information to be publicly disclosed is a subset of the information reported to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It includes the conflicted investigator's name, title, and role; the name of any entities in which the investigator has an SFI; the nature of the SFI; and the annual dollar value in specified ranges. In addition to federal agencies, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE), and other organizations recommend or require disclosure. Disclosure provides a measure of fairness to the recipient of the disclosure, whether a research subject, reader of a published work, or listener at a lecture. Yet disclosure may not have the intended effect on the target audience; it might not mitigate bias by itself (Cain et al. 2011; Cain et al. 2005). Despite this, disclosure is usually a best practice. In many cases, disclosing relevant financial interests and relationships in the course of one's professional activities is a necessary but insufficient step toward managing COI.","Elements of a Management Plan, funding agency, FCOI, management plan, Promoting Objectivity in Research, conflicted Investigator, research project, conditions, safeguard objectivity, Investigator's agreement, monitored, compliance, FDA Reporting Requirements, Investigational New Drug, Investigational Device Exemption, IND/IDE, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, FDA regulations, financial disclosures, sponsor, sponsor-investigator, Public Disclosure Standards, PHS regulations, National Institutes of Health, NIH, conflicted investigator, SFI, Association of American Medical Colleges, AAMC, International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, ICMJE, disclosure, fairness, professional activities, COI","mindmap

"Retrospective Review, Identification of Bias, and Mitigation Reporting Requirement If a researcher does not disclose an SFI in a timely manner, or if for any reason the institution did not previously review it, the institution must, within 60 days from that point, determine whether the SFI relates to PHS-funded research and if it is an FCOI. If it is an FCOI, the institution must implement, at least on an interim basis, a management plan. When a researcher fails to disclose an FCOI in a timely manner or comply with a management plan, or where the institution fails to manage an FCOI, the institution must, within 120 days, complete a retrospective review of research to determine whether there was bias in the design, conduct, or reporting of the research conducted during the period of noncompliance. If an institution identifies bias, it must develop a mitigation report that outlines a plan of action to eliminate or mitigate the effect of the bias. The institution must report the results of that determination and the mitigation report to the PHS. COI for Awardees and Subrecipients The revised HHS regulations have specific requirements for collaborative PHS-funded research between awardee institutions and their subrecipients. Financial interests must be monitored and dealt with at the awardee institutions to assure the PHS of the appropriate identification and elimination or management of the FCOI. The collaborating institutions can accomplish this through an agreement that specifies which institution's COI policy will apply to the research project (assuming the collaborating institutions both have PHS-compliant policies). A Start-up Company to Field Test a Psychological Assessment Tool Researchers at an academic center have developed a new medical device that can be implanted using a much less invasive procedure than conventional surgery. Dr. Smith, a psychology faculty member, wishes to test her hypothesis that there are significant psychological benefits of the speedier recovery from this procedure. Dr. Smith will use an assessment tool she developed to quantify the speed of recovery and relative postsurgical well-being of patients receiving either standard surgical treatment or less invasive surgery with the new device. Dr. Smith obtained a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to fund the studies that will test her hypothesis. After eight months of NIMH funding, Dr. Smith discloses to the institution that a year ago her assessment tool was patented and commercialized by the institution, sold to a company (Surgery Devices, LLC), and she has been getting a portion of the royalties that come to the institution for its sale and use. She also disclosed that up until six months ago she consulted for Surgery Devices, LLC and received $8,500 for the 12 months prior to the termination of the consulting relationship.","Retrospective Review, Identification of Bias, Mitigation Reporting Requirement, Significant Financial Interest (SFI), PHS-funded research, Financial Conflict of Interest (FCOI), management plan, retrospective review, bias, mitigation report, COI for Awardees and Subrecipients, HHS regulations, collaborative PHS-funded research, awardee institutions, subrecipients, COI policy, Start-up Company, Psychological Assessment Tool, medical device, less invasive procedure, Dr. Smith, speedier recovery, assessment tool, National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Surgery Devices, LLC, consulting relationship","mindmap
